# Refund by Location Smart Contract Dapps-GPS
Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. Among cryptocurrencies, Ether is second only to Bitcoin in market capitalization. Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin.

## Introduction

The refund by location smart contract is aimed to be used when one party, for example an employer, agrees to pay another party, for example an employee, for being present in a certain geographic area for a certain duration. The employee’s phone sends its GPS location to a smart contract at a certain interval. Based on the pre-agreed contract codified in an Ethereum smart contract, a cryptocurrency payment is executed when all the agreed conditions are met.  

If, at any point, the GPS sensor indicates that an employee is outside the range of the agreed GPS area, the contract state will be updated to indicate that it is out of compliance.  

## objective

produce an Ethereum based dApp thathas both the smart contract tested and deployed in a testnetand
produce an Ethereum based dApp that has both the smart contract tested and deployed in a testnet and a front end that will allow monitoring of the status.

## Plan
* Steps to do the project:
- [ ] Developing smart contract.
    - [ ] Use solidity programming
    - [ ]  Testing and deploying the contract on ethereum blockchain
- [ ]  Building frontend web dApp
    - [ ]  Designing the user interface
    - [ ]  Doing it with Reactjs
- [ ]  Connecting the frontend and smart contract backend
## Implementation
- [ ] Frontend  with reactjs
- [ ] Backendwith solidity for the smart contract and hardhat frame work is used
